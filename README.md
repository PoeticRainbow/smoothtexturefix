# SmoothTextureFix
With the addition of Anisotropic Filtering and RGSS in Minecraft 1.21.11 (Mounts of Mayhem), the visuals of the game have changed. There is a noticeable amount of blur on block textures. Margins between blocks still have the old harsh cutoff which is very noticeable. This mod sets the texture filtering back to Nearest/Point like it always should be. <3

Can be toggled on/off with the config file (`config/smoothtexturefix.json`) or the client-side command `/smoothtexturefix`.
